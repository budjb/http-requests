== Filters

Filters may be added to the `HttpRequest` to modify or react to certain events in the lifecycle of an HTTP request.
There are various filter types available, each providing an injection point into the request lifecycle, as explained
below.

=== RequestFilter

Applications may need to intercept an HTTP request directly before the request is actually made to modify the request
in some manner. A great example of a use of this filter is the built-in `BasicAuthFilter`

[source,java]
----
// Adding a BasicAuthFilter to the request will automatically apply the required
// headers for Basic Authentication.
HttpRequest request = new HttpRequest("https://example.com");
request.addFilter(new BasicAuthFilter('username', 'password'));
----

=== OutputStreamFilter

This filter allows applications to modify the `OutputStream` sent to the actual HTTP connection before it is sent.
An example of a built-in filter that uses this functionality is the `GZIPFilter`, which wraps the output stream
in a `GZIPOutputStream`.

=== HttpClientResponseFilter

The response filter is called after a response has been received from the HTTP request. This filter provides an
opportunity to modify the `HttpResponse` before it is returned.

=== RetryFilter

The retry filter allows applications to determine if a request should be retried based on some criteria. If any
one retry filter determines that the request should be retried, the request will be submitted again until no more
retry filters request a retry.

A use case for this functionality is authentication schemes that provide an authentication token that can be reused
until it expires. A retry filter might be created for this type of authentication scheme that inspects the response
of a call to the service that requires the authentication token, and re-authenticates if the previous authentication
token has expired. Once a new authentication token is obtained, the original request can be retried with the updated
authentication token.

TIP: There is a built-in `AuthenticationTokenHeaderFilter` class that creates a framework for this type of
authentication scheme.

=== LifecycleFilter

This filter provides several integration points related to the lifecycle of the request. The interfaces includes
default, empty implementations of each available method so that only the methods a filter need only override the methods
it requires. Each of the methods in this interface as passed an `HttpContext`, which contains the request, method,
request entity, the response, and a property repository. This allows filters to maintain some state during the course
of the request. The methods available are as follows.

* `onStart` is called before any processing of the request is started.
* `onRequest` is called directly before the request is executed, and is the last chance to modify the request before it
  is sent over the wire.
* `onResponse` is similar in purpose to `onRequest`, but is called once a response has been received.
* `onComplete` is called once the HTTP request has completed and no further retries have been requested. This is the
  final filter opportunity before the response is returned to the caller.

=== Built-In Filters

The library includes several built-in filters for common use cases.

==== BasicAuthFilter

The basic authentication filter provides simple basic auth functionality with a username and a password.

==== GZIPFilter

The GZIP filter wraps the output of the request with a `GZIPOutputStream` so that the entity's contents are compressed
with the GZIP algorithm. The appropriate `Content-Encoding` header is set.

==== DeflateFilter

The deflate filter wraps the output of the request with a `DeflateOutputStream` so that the entity's contents are
compressed with the deflate algorithm. The appropriate `Content-Encoding` header is set.

==== AuthenticationTokenHeaderFilter

This filter is abstract and provides a framework for HTTP requests that require token authentication and follow the
flow:

. If no authentication token is known, authenticate.
. Make the HTTP request.
. If HTTP status 401 is received, and no retries have been attempted, re-authenticate and request a retry.

The filter provides integration points so that authentication logic and authentication token header names can be
provided by concrete implementations of the filter.

==== LoggingFilter

The logging filter captures the contents of the request and the response and logs it. The `LoggingFilter` itself is an
abstract class, and there are a couple bundled implementations.

===== ConsoleLoggingFilter

The `ConsoleLoggingFilter` is a concrete implementation of `LoggingFilter` that prints the contents of the log to the
Java console.

===== Slf4jLoggingFilter

The `Slf4jLoggingFilter` is a concrete implementation of `LoggingFilter` that logs the contents of the log to an SLF4J
logger. The filter can be configured with a logger name to use, otherwise the fully-qualified class name of the logging
filter will be used. By default, the log is configured to log at the `TRACE` level. The filter can be configured to log
at a different level if desired.

==== HttpStatusExceptionFilter

The `HttpStatusExceptionFilter` filter modifies how the response status is treated. When an HTTP status that
is not considered successful (that is, not in the 200-299 range), an exception representing that status code is thrown.
For example, if an `HTTP 404` is received, an `HttpNotFoundException` will be thrown.

TIP: Use this functionality to create different error handling for expected error cases.

If no appropriate exception exists for the HTTP status code that is received, an `HttpStatusException` is thrown
instead. This exception is actually the superclass of all HTTP status specific exceptions.

These exceptions contain the following information about the response:

.HttpStatusException Properties
[grid="rows", cols=[1,3]
|====
| Property | Description

| status | The HTTP status code of the response, as an `Integer`.
| response | The `HttpResponse` object containing details about the received response.
