== Filters

The `HttpClient` supports the use of filter objects so that applications can react to certain events in the lifecycle
of an HTTP request.

Filters can be added to the `HttpClientFactory` or to the `HttpClient` directly. Any filters registered with the
`HttpClientFactory` will automatically be assigned to any `HttpClient` instance the factory creates. For both objects,
the following methods are available to work with filters.

* `addFilter`
* `removeFilter`
* `clearFilters`
* `getFilters`

=== HttpClientRequestFilter

Applications may need to intercept an HTTP request directly before the request is actually made to modify the request
parameters. Any request filter that is registered with the `HttpClient` will be called directly before the request
is made.

A great example of a use of this filter is the built-in `BasicAuthFilter`

[source,groovy]
----
// given a client has been created...
client.addFilter(new BasicAuthFilter('username', 'password'))
----

The `BasicAuthFilter` is built with the credentials for the request, and the request is updated with that information
just before the request is actually made.

=== HttpClientRequestEntityFilter

This filter allows applications to modify the `OutputStream` sent to the actual HTTP connection before it is sent.
An example of a built-in filter that uses this functionality is the `GZIPFilter`, which wraps the output stream
in a `GZIPOutputStream`.

=== HttpClientLifecycleFilter

This filter is actually a trait that provides several integration points related to the lifecycle of the request.
The trait provides base implementations of each available method so that only the methods a filter cares about must
be overridden. The methods available are as follows.

* `onRequest` is available to inspect the request properties and the `OutputStream`, but it should not change anything.
  This filter method differs from the request filter in that the former is meant to modify the request, while this
  filter is meant to inspect it once all changes have been made.
* `onResponse` is similar in purpose to `onRequest`, but is called once a response has been received.
* `onComplete` is called once the HTTP request has completed and no further retries have been requested. This is the
  final filter opportunity before the HTTP request call returns to the caller.

=== HttpClientResponseFilter

The response filter is called after a response has been received from the HTTP request. This filter provides an
opportunity to modify the `HttpResponse`.

=== HttpClientResponseEntityFilter

The response entity filter is called after a response has been received from the HTTP request. This filter provides an
opportunity to modify the response's entity `InputStream`.

=== HttpClientRetryFilter

The retry filter allows applications to determine if a request should be retried based on some criteria. If any
one retry filter determines that the request should be retried, the request will be submitted again until no more
retry filters request a retry.

A use case for this functionality is authentication schemes that provide an authentication token that can be reused
until it expires. A retry filter might be created for this type of authentication scheme that inspects the response
of a call to the service that requires the authentication token, and re-authenticates if the previous authentication
token has expired. Once a new authentication token is obtained, the original request can be retried with the updated
authentication token.

TIP: There is a built-in `AuthenticationTokenHeaderFilter` class that creates a framework for this type of
authentication scheme.

=== Filter Chain

The graphic below illustrates the order in which the filters explained above are called during the process of making
an HTTP request.

=== Built-In Filters

The library includes several built-in filters for common use cases.

==== BasicAuthFilter

The basic authentication filter provides simple basic auth functionality with a username and a password.

==== GZIPFilter

The GZIP filter wraps the output of the request with a `GZIPOutputStream` so that the entity's contents are compressed
with the GZIP algorithm. The appropriate `Content-Encoding` header is set.

==== DeflateFilter

The deflate filter wraps the output of the request with a `DeflateOutputStream` so that the entity's contents are
compressed with the deflate algorithm. The appropriate `Content-Encoding` header is set.

==== AuthenticationTokenHeaderFilter

This filter is abstract and provides a framework for HTTP requests that require token authentication and follow the
flow:

. If no authentication token is known, authenticate.
. Make the HTTP request.
. If HTTP status 401 is received, and no retries have been attempted, re-authenticate and request a retry.

The filter provides integration points so that authentication logic and authentication token header names can be
provided by concrete implementations of the filter.

==== LoggingFilter

The logging filter captures the contents of the request and the response, and logs the data to an SLF4j logger. The
filter can be configured with a logger name to use, otherwise the fully-qualified class name of the logging filter
will be used.

==== HttpStatusExceptionFilter

The `HttpStatusExceptionFilter` filter modifies how the response status is treated. When an HTTP status that
is not considered successful (that is, not in the 200-299 range), an exception representing that status code is thrown.
For example, if an `HTTP 404` is received, an `HttpNotFoundException` will be thrown.

TIP: Use this functionality to create different error handling for expected error cases.

If no appropriate exception exists for the HTTP status code that is received, an `HttpStatusException` is thrown
instead. This exception is actually the superclass of all HTTP status specific exceptions.

These exceptions contain the following information about the response:

[grid="rows"]
|====
| Property | Description

| status | The HTTP status code of the response, as an `Integer`.
| response | The `HttpResponse` object containing details about the received response.
