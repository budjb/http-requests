== Spring Boot Integration

The `http-requests-spring` is available to automatically configure the various library components to the application
context as Spring beans. It supports automatic entity converter registry for all entity converters that are registered
as beans, and it automatically configures the `HttpClientFactory` instance as a bean depending on which provider is
present on the classpath.

NOTE: Auto configuration must be enabled for the HTTP requests components to be automatically registered.
This can be enabled with the `EnableAutoConfiguration` annotation on the main application class or a `Configuration`
class. Alternatively, the `HttpRequestsAutoConfiguration` configuration class may be configured as a bean to accomplish
automatic configuration of the library.

With the Spring support added, other beans may inject the `HttpClientFactory` (with the name `httpClientFactory`) bean
as a dependency.
