=== EntityConverterManager

The `EntityConverterManager` serves as both a place to aggregate entity converters and as an entry point to object
marshalling.

.Example Usage
[source,java]
----
EntityConverterManager converterManager = new EntityConverterManager();

converterManager.add(new ExampleWriter());
converterManager.add(new ExampleReader());
----

The converter manager may be used directly to marshal objects to and from `InputStream` instances, but it is intended
to be a support component of `HttpClient`. Therefore, the converter manager is a requirement to build an
`HttpClientFactory`.
